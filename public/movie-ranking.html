The movie is not very scary but it does grip you in. The plot twists work very well and the potrayal of the villain is justified.The one thing I loved about it is that they didn't ignore traumas of people. It is handled in a healthy way. The buddy cop, grumpy x sunshine part worked really well too. We need more of these normal paced cop thrillers with western influences on tropes.</p>

I went crazy after watching this. It also got me sobbing in the theatre. It has the tragedy we love, the cute glances we adore and ofcourse the fiery chemistry we never forget. The movie is truly an epic but I get why the book readers would be disappointed. Since I never read the book, I enjoyed the whole experience. It did leave my eyes wet for the whole week. I'd call it a hangover but this is definitely not something you recover from. As GenZ says, it altered my brain chemistry.</p>
<h4>3.Virupaksha</h4>
<p>7/10<br/>
It is a good horror film, except the 'ghost' didn't scare me as much as the crows did lol. I liked the plot twist but the whole time i was screaming at the screen because of how the characters reacted to what was happening. And the cliche of the leads falling in love way too quickly didn't really work for me. The hero keeps talking about this true love, they did connect it well in the end but come on you knew her for less than 24 hours and suddenly she becomes your soulmate? It is just attraction bruh!</p>

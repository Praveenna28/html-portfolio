<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm Praveenna. I'm a creative person in general, you can find lots of journals in my cupboard filled with paintings, doodles, sketches and what not. I am also an engineering student. I've barely got time but I still try my best to balance my hobbies and studies. </p>

<p>Random fact about me: I write poems! And I write more than I read. Injust love finding metaphors and playing with words to bring out a simple thought. All my poems are close to my heart<3</p>

<p>I've just started my web dev journey. Stay tuned to find out where it takes me.</p>
